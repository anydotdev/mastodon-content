<h1 id="about">Welcome to any.dev</h1>

This server was created to have an online space for all sorts of developers and nerds.

Note: this code of conduct is a work in progress. Improvements and suggestions that make our community more inclusive
are warmly welcomed via email or DM.

* * *

<h1 id="coc">Our code of conduct</h1>

As a user of any.dev, you agree to uphold an environment of respect and consideration for all users.

Any conduct that is deemed hateful or oppressive is grounds for removal from any.dev. Any language or action that
expresses, reinforces, upholds or sympathizes with any form of systemic social domination is considered oppressive and
is grounds for removal at any level deemed appropriate by the admins.

<h2 id="etiquette">Recommended Etiquette</h2>

We have provided some guidelines and recommendations for joining and participating in our community. Please keep in mind
that these guidelines are designed to encourage positive and supportive interactions within any.dev, _not_ to
restrict behavior.

Community members are encouraged to share and recommend these best practices to their fellow community members by
posting to your own timeline, especially when someone joins on your invite.

<h3>1. Introduce yourself</h3>  

Once you've had some time to get the lay of the land, it's a great idea to write a quick #introduction (and include that
hashtag so others can find it). Bonus points for sharing something about Philly in your intro, like a fav place/thing to
do/etc.

<h3>2. Before you promote, participate</h3>  

It's super cool to share the stuff you're working on, invite people to events, ask for help, share work
opportunities/gigs, etc.

_But please try not to make these your first or only posts!_

You can join in the conversation, say hello, make an introduction post, even share _other_ people's stuff. All of these
things will help you build connections and earn trust.

People are way more likely to pay attention to (and boost/click/share) the stuff you share if they recognize you!

In general, promoting stuff is good. It's how we learn what's going on, and help each other. If you're active in the
community and sharing something you think others might like, you don't have to worry. Drive-by promotion doesn't help
the community, so please try to avoid it.

If you see individuals, businesses, or brands promoting without participating, please report their posts so we can guide
their approach to participating in our server.

<h3>3. Consider using Content Warnings</h3>

One of our goals with any.dev is to create a space where we are not overwhelmed by reactivity, or are bombarded by
the 24 hour news cycle. One of the tools we have for doing that is using the built
in "[content warning](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#cw)" option when posting to our server.

**In 99% of cases on any.dev content Content Warnings are a tool, not a policy.** We do NOT wish to restrict our
members sharing their lived experiences, which may include their own work, personal experiences, and interactions with
negative things in the world.

But if you're sharing links, news, photos, and other 3rd party sources that fall under the categories below, you can
think of Content Warnings as a way to proactively let fellow any.dev members "opt-in" to reading your post:

* Politics (local or national)
* Graphic violence, gore, or self-harm
* Sexual content, adult themes or nudity
* Spoilers for TV, movies, books, video games, and other popular media
* Flashing video/gifs
* Discussions surrounding hate topics including racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, antisemitism, etc. Remember
  that these _behaviors_ are strictly not welcome on this server, but discussion about their occurrences are allowed.

Also note that if there is a topic that is allowed by our Code of Conduct, but you do not wish to see on your timeline
for any reason, you are encouraged to use the built in [filters feature](https://any.dev/filters) on your account.

<h2 id="nofly">No Fly Zone:</h2>

any.dev is moderated by human beings, which means we rely on our community to help us find and identify content and
accounts that are not allowed on our server.

Please use [report feature](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moderating/#report) to help us quickly address posts and
accounts that should be removed.

### The following types of content will be removed from the public timeline, and may result in an immediate ban from any.dev:

* All forms of hate and the advocacy of hate, including but not limited to Racism, Sexism, Misogyny, Homophobia,
  Transphobia, Xenophobia, Nationalism, and antisemitism.
* Trolling and/or personal attacks
* Intentional misinformation
* Untagged pornography and content that depicts sex acts
* Crypto, gambling, scams, or MLMs
* Unapproved bots (for approval, please contact the admins)

* Conduct promoting the ideology of fascism/radical nationalism
* Promoting the oppression of any group based on gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
  personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, class, or other identity\*

Any conduct intended to stalk, harass, or intimidate other users, or to impede other users from utilizing the service,
or to degrade the performance of the service, or to harass other users, or to incite other users to perform any of the
aforementioned actions is forbidden and subject to punishment up to and including a ban from any.dev.

### This can include, but is not limited to, the following behaviors:

* Continuing to engage in conversation with a user that has specifically requested for said engagement to cease may be
  considered harassment, regardless of platform-specific privacy tools employed.
* Aggregating, posting, and/or disseminating a person's demographic, personal, or private data without express
  permission.
* Inciting users to engage another user in continued interaction or discussion after a user has requested for said
  engagement with that user to cease and desist may be considered harassment.
* Posting and/or disseminating a person's posts ("toots"), including screen captures or any other content without
  express permission.
* Intentionally posting or disseminating libel, slander, or other disinformation.

This Code of Conduct applies both to content on any.dev and to public spaces when an individual is representing
any.dev or its community.

Reports of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be made by using the report button. All reports
will be reviewed and dealt with as soon as possible. Admins are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the
reporter of an incident.

The admins reserves the right to revoke any user's content on or access to any.dev, at any time, for any reason.

No creepy crawlies (robot.txt set to disallow).

No secret crypto mining operations (yes, that's a thing people do now).
